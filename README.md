# Freight-Route-Analysis-and-Optimization
Worked on freight optimization from multi pick-up location to the drop locations with the capacity constraint and under a time window.
Performed comprehensive data cleaning, transformation and feature engineering to prepare disparate datasets for analysis and model input.
Utilized K-Means clustering with Elbow/Silhouette methods to strategically group delivery destinations based on their origins.
Designed a Heuristic algorithm for load planning, using TSP to optimize routes for LTL/TL within 7 day consolidation windows.
